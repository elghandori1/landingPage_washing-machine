## Custom landing page for a washing machine product:
Custom landing page for a washing machine product, programmed using various techniques such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.

The landing page stands out with its innovative and attractive design, aiming to attract visitors and persuade them of the benefits and features of the washing machine it promotes. HTML was used to create the page structure and organize the content, while CSS was utilized to style the elements and make them visually appealing and cohesive.

JavaScript was used to add interactive functionalities to the page, allowing visitors to engage with the content in exciting and enjoyable ways. For example, users can click on an image to display the main view, with the feature of activating the night mode.

Furthermore, Bootstrap was employed to provide a robust and responsive framework for the design, making it easier to organize and arrange elements and achieve a seamless and responsive user experience across various devices and screens.

Regarding storing the information submitted from the form, Google Sheets was used as the interface for data storage. This means that when a visitor fills out and submits the form, the entered data is saved in a Google Sheets data table, making it easy for you to access and use it later. There's also a mechanism to ensure that all information is entered; if a field is left empty, a message is displayed to notify the user.

Overall, this product is an effective and innovative landing page for a washing machine product, combining various technologies and an appealing design to attract users and convert them into potential customers.
